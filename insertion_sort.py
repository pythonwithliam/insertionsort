# Insertion Sort Python 3.x implementation
# Complexity O(n^2)

# Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted
# array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists
# than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
# However, insertion sort provides several advantages:
# * Efficient for (quite) small data sets, much like other quadratic sorting
#       algorithms
# * Does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys
# * Only requires a constant amount O(1) of additional memory space
# * Can sort a list as it receives it
